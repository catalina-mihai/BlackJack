############### Thomas' and Catalina's Blackjack Project #####################


############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## We play with just one deck of 52 cards.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1. -> The first ACE dealt is of value 11 and subsequent ACEs of value 1.
##                                   -> Should the score of a player exceed 21 then the value of the ACE is changed to 1.
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn to begin with.
## But cards are removed from the deck as they are drawn.

## NOTE to the lead developer (aka Thomas :) ). When I am referring to 'dealer' I mean a virtual player for which the computer takes decisions.
# I also refer to the 'computer' and by computer I mean the program/mechanism and all code behind. So not to be confused with the dealer.
## Let me give you an example. When the 'computer' deals 2 cards to the player called 'dealer' it is the computer/mechanism that peaks
## into the cards dealt and checks automatically for blackjack. So the 'dealer-player' is blind to the card that is hidden.

##################### STEPS #####################


## initialising steps:
## create a DECK and shuffle it
## after each step the score needs to update and be printed. Check for BlackJack or Game Over

## STEP 1: DEAL CARDS
## Deal 2 cards to player
## Deal 2 cards to dealer. One card is hidden but computer peaks for the next step where we check for Blackjack.

## STEP 2: BLACKJACK?
## If dealer was dealt a 10 card or ACE then computer checks for BLACKJACK. If BlackJAck -> check for TIE
## If player has BLACKJACK -> check for TIE
## (If the summed value of the cards is 21 then it's a BLACKJACK)
##Then reveal dealers cards too and check if it is a TIE (if both have blackjack)

## STEP 3. GAME OVER?
## A player is BUST or in other words the GAME is OVER when the score exceeds 21 points
## We check the player's score. If sum over 21 then we check for any ACEs.
## If there is an ACE we change the value of it from 11 to 1.
## If the sum of the player's score is still over 21 then the player loses the game regardless of the dealer's hand

## STEP 4. PLAYER'S TURN
## Ask for user input.

## STEP 5. DEALER'S TURN
## Once the user is done, it's time to let the dealer play. The dealer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.


## STEP 6. WIN, LOSS OR TIE?

## STEP 7. PLAY AGAIN?
## We ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
